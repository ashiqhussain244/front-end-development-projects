                <p>Feature selection is the process of reducing the number of input variables 
                    when developing a predictive model. It is desirable to reduce the number of input variables 
                    to both reduce the computational cost of modeling and, in some cases</p>  <br>
                    <p>Occasionally you may want to keep all the features in your final model, 
                        but you don’t want the model to focus too much on any one coefficient.
                        Ridge regression can do this by penalizing the beta coefficients of a model for being too large. 
                        Basically, it scales back the strength of correlation with variables that may not be as important as others. 
                        This takes care of any multicollinearity (relationships among features that will inflate their betas)
                        that may be present in your data. Ride Regression is done by adding a penalty term (also called ridge estimator 
                        or shrinkage estimator) to the cost function of the regression. The penalty term takes all of the betas and scales
                        them by a term lambda (λ) that must be tuned (usually with cross validation: compares the same model but with 
                        different values of lambda). Lambda is a value between 0 and infinity, although it is good to start with values 
                        between 0 and 1. The higher the value of lambda, the more the coefficients are shrunk. When lambda is equal to 0,
                        the result will be a regular ordinary least squares model with no penalty.</p><br>
